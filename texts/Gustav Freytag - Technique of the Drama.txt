BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.
Gustav Freytag, scholar, poet, novelist, critic, play
wright, editor, soldier, publicist, was born in Kreuzburg,
Silesia, in 1816. Still living in quiet retirement in Wies
baden, he is one of the best known of modern German
writers.

His preliminary education was acquired at the

Gymnasium of Oels, which he entered in 1829, at the age
of thirteen.
In 1835, he began the study of German
philology under Hoffmann, at the University of Bres-

THE IDEA.

In the soul of the

poet, the drama gradually

takes shape out of the crude material furnished by
the account of some striking event.
First appear ',
single movements ; internal conflicts and personal
resolution, a deed fraught with consequence, the
collision of two characters, the opposition of a hero
to his surroundings, rise so prominently above their
connection with other incidents, that they become
the occasion for the transformation of other mate

Alongside this goes further creative work

the chief

characters are developed, to their distinct individu

some accomplice of the father, another woman, the
opposite of the beloved, personality of the parents ;
new impulses are given to the action, and all these

inventions are determined and ruled by the idea of
the piece.
This idea, the first invention of the poet, the
silent soul through which he gives life to the mate
rial coming to him from external sources, does not
easily place itself before him as a clearly defined
thought ; it has not the colorless clearness of an
abstract conception.
On the contrary, the peculiar

If, however, it is inconvenient and often difficult

for him to cast the idea of a growing play into a for
mula, to express it in words, yet the poet will do
well, even in the beginning of his work, to temper
the ardor of his soul, and sharply discriminating,
judge the idea according to the essential requisites

of the drama.
It is instructive for a stranger to a
piece to seek the hidden soul in the complete pro
duction, and however imperfect this may possibly
be, give the thought formal expression.

Historical material is already brought into order
through some idea, before the poet takes possession

on every part of the work which is brought through
them into being. Whoever describes the life of a
man, whoever makes an exposition of a section of
past time, must set in order his mass of material

Shakespeare, above all others, has given hints to

At that time there was no writing of his

made use of material from historic resources for his
artistic figures, he wrought from an abundance, and
opened up the immediate past to his nation, in a
multitude of masterly character sketches. But he,
himself, achieved for the stage of his time the

the like.
And as a rule the later poet will be
inclined to do too much rather than too little in this
direction.

It may happen

to him rather than to the Greek,

therefore, that through full elaboration of the action,
the inner perturbation of the chief figures may be
disproportionately restricted, and that an important
portentous series of moods, remains
unexpressed. A well known example of such a
defect is in Prince of Homburg, the very piece in
which the poet has superbly achieved one of the

his death-warrant is awaiting the signature, his mood
naturally becomes serious, and he determines to
entreat the intercession of the electoral princess.

And in the next scene, the young hero throws him
self powerless, and without self-control, at the feet
of his protectress, because, as he relates, he has
seen on his way to her, men digging his grave
by torchlight ; he begs for his life, though he may
be shamefully degraded.
This sudden plunge to a
cowardly fear of death, does painful violence to the

character of a general.

itself, even if we unwillingly tolerate lack of selfcontrol in a general under such circumstances. And

It was therefore a chief

task to present the abasement of a youthful heroic
nature even to the fear of death, and indeed, in such a

manner that the sympathy of the hearer should not

only by an accurate exhibition of the inner perturba

anguish, which terminated in the prostration at the
princess's feet — a difficult task for even powerful
poetic genius, but one which must be performed.

And yet, it is presented in only brief
sections ; the culmination of the action is divided
up into little scenes, and the joining of these into
one well-executed scene was the more desirable,
because the important occurrence in the last half of

— nowhere need we fear the effects on the stage, of

While the Greek stage was developed out of a lyric
representation of passionate emotions, the German

in the background the moment of the deed, as the
Germans rejoiced to picture fighting and rapine.

the actors was the ultimate reason.

From this internal throng of scenic contrasts in
the action, there has originated what, to the Ger
mans, is the favorite scene of tragedy — the lumin
ous and fervid part which, as a rule, embraces the

touching moments, in contrast with the thrilling
moments of the chief action. These scenic con
trasts, however, are produced not only through a
variation of meaning, but also through a change of
amplified and concise scenes, of scenes of two, and
of many persons.
Among the Greeks, scenes moved

WHAT IS TRAGIC

It

?

is well known

how busily the German poets
since Lessing's time, have been occupied in explor
ing that mysterious property of the drama which is
called the tragic.
It should be the quality which
the poet's moral theory of life deposits in the piece ;
and the poet should be, through moral influences, a
fashioner of his time.
The tragic should be an
ethical force with which the poet has to fill his
action and his characters ; and in this case,, there have
been only diverse opinions as to the essential nature

of dramatic ethical force.
The expressions, tragic
guilt, inner purification, poetic justice, have become
convenient watchwords of criticism, conveying, how
ever, a different meaning to different persons.
But
in this all agree, that the tragic effect of the drama
depends on the manner in which

the poet conducts
his characters through the action, portions their fate
to them, and guides and terminates the struggle of
their one-sided desire against opposing forces.
Since the poet with freedom joins the parts of
his action so as to produce unity, and since he pro
duces this unity by setting together the individual
nal consistency, it

his comprehension of the general consistency of all
things, his view of Providence and destiny, must be
expressed in a poetic invention, which derives from
the inner nature

of some important personage sus

taining great relations, his deeds and his sorrows. It
is further plain that it devolves on the poet to con
duct this struggle to such a close as shall not shock
the humanity and the reason of the hearer, but
shall satisfy it ; and that for the good effect of his
drama, it is not at all a matter of indifference whether
in deducing guilt from the soul of the hero, and in

from the compelling force of
the action, he shows himself a man of good judg

Mani
festly he who has developed in his own life a high
degree of culture, a comprehensive knowledge of
men, and a manly character, will, according to the

view of his contemporaries, best direct the destiny
of his hero ; for what shines forth from the drama
is only the reflection of the poet's own conception

of the great world-relations.

It

cannot be taught ;
it cannot be inserted into a single drama like a role
or a scene.
Therefore, in answer to the question, how the
poet must compose his action so that it may be
tragic in this sense, the advice, meant in all serious
ness, is given that he need trouble himself very little
about it.

fancy and the judgment, and through the perfect

dramatic poetry alone.
The penetrating force of
this dramatic effect is, with the majority of people,
greater than the force of effects produced by any
other form of art. Only music is able to make its

through which he had arisen, and his participation
in the execution of the king, had stirred the hearts
of the conservative against him ; that the great
hero from the pressure which his earlier life had
laid upon him, could not wrest himself free from
his office, — this makes the shadow which fell upon
his life through his unlawful reign, tragic for us.
That Conradin, child of the Hohenstaufens, gath
ered a horde, and was slain in Italy by his adver

sary, — this is not in itself dramatic, and in no sense
of the word tragic.
A weak youth, with slender
support, — it was in order that he should succumb.
But when it is impressed upon our souls, that the

youth only followed the old line of march of his
ancestors toward Italy, and that in this line of
march, almost all the great princes of his house
had fallen, and that this march of an imperial race
was not accidental, but rested on ancient, historical

union of Germany with Italy, — then the death of
Conradin appears to us specially tragic, not for
himself, but as the final extinction of the greatest
race of rulers of that time.

With peculiar emphasis, it must again be asserted
that the

tragic force must be understood in its
rational causative connection with the fundamental

conditions

of the action.

here, though the parts of the drama will be

discussed in the following chapter.
The point forward from which the deed of the
hero reacts upon himself, is one of the most impor
tant in the play. This beginning of the reaction,
sometimes united in one scene with the climax, has
been noted ever since there has been a dramatic art.

The embarrassment of the hero and the momentous
position into which he has placed himself, must be
impressively represented ; at the same time, it is the
business of this force to produce new suspense for
the second part of the piece, and so much the more
as the apparent success of the hero, has so far been
more brilliant, and the more magnificently the scene

must be pregnant with consequences.
Therefore it
must have importance and a certain magnitude.

This scene of the tragic force either immediately
follows the scene of the climax, like the despair of
Juliet after Romeo's departure ; or is joined by a
connecting scene, like the speech of Antony after
Csesar's murder; or it is coupled with the climax
scene into scenic unity, as in Mary Stuart ; or it is
entirely separated from it by the close of an act, as
in Love and Intrigue, where Louise's writing the
letter indicates the climax, and Ferdinand's convic
tion of the infidelity of his beloved forms the tragic
force.
Such scenes almost always stand in the

Revolution (Peripeteia), is the name given by
the Greeks to that tragic force which by the sud
den intrusion of an event, unforeseen and over
whelming but already grounded in the plan of the
action, impels the volition of the hero, and with
it the action itself in a direction entirely different
from that of the beginning.
Examples of such
revolution scenes are the change in the prospects of
Neoptolemus in Pkiloctetes, the announcement of the
messenger and the shepherd to Jocasta and the king
in King CEdipus, the account of Hyllos to Deianeira, concerning the effect of the shirt of Nessos,
in The Trachinian Women.

CHAPTER II.
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DRAMA.
I.

PLAY AND COUNTERPLAY.
In an action, through characters, by means of
words, tones, gestures, the drama presents those
soul-processes which man experiences, from the
flashing up of an idea, to passionate desire and to a
deed, as well as those

inward emotions which are

excited by his own deeds and those of others.
The structure of the drama must show these two
"contrasted
elements of the dramatic joined in a
unity, efflux and influx of will-power, the accom
plishment of a deed and its reaction on the
soul, movement and counter-movement, strife and
counter-strife,

rising

and

sinking,

binding and

loosing.

In every part of the drama, both tendencies- of
dramatic life appear, each incessantly challenging
the other to its best in play and counter-play

THE CONSTRUCTION

OF THE DRAMA.

105

the hero must be endowed with a strong life, with a

certain one-sidedness, and be in embarrassment, the
opposing

power must be made visible in a human

representative.
It is quite indifferent

in favor of which of the
contending parties the greater degree of justice lies,
whether a character or his adversary is bettermannered, more favored by law, embodies more of
the traditions of the time, possesses more of the
ethical spirit of the poet ; in both groups, good and
evil, power and weakness, are variously mingled.

But both must be endowed with what is universally,;

advantage which he wins for himself, must be the
greater, so much the greater the more perfectly the
final outcome of the struggle shows him to be van
quished.
These two chief parts of the drama are firmly
united by a point of the action which lies directly in
the middle.
This middle, the climax of the play, is
the most important place of the structure ; the action
rises to this ; the action falls away from this.
It is
now decisive for the character of the drama which
of the two refractions of the dramatic light shall
have a place in the first part of the play, which shall
fall in the second part as the dominating influence ;

in every respect.
It is true the fatal ending is, in
the case of modern subjects, less a necessity than in
the dramatic treatment of epic legends, or older
historical events ; but not that the hero's at last
remaining alive makes a piece a spectacle play, but
that he proceeds from the strife as conqueror, or by
an adjustment with his opponent, goes away recon

he must be the victim at last, if he must

then the piece retains not only the

Homburg is a spectacle play, Tasso is a tragedy.
The drama of modern times has embraced in the
circle of its subjects, a broad field which was
unknown to the tragedy of the ancient Greeks,
indeed, in the main, to Shakespeare's art : the mid
dle-class life of the present time, the conflicts of
our society. No doubt, the strifes and sufferings of
modern life make a tragic treatment possible ; and
this has fallen too little to their lot ; but what is
full of incident, what is quiet, what is full of scruple,
connected as a rule with this species of material,
affords artistic conception full justification ; and just
here it brings forward such strifes as in real life we
trust to have and want to have adjusted peaceably.

it is produced far more through the correct feeling

As to the scenes of this rising movement, it may
be said, they have to produce a progressive inten

evince progress in their import, but they must show
an enlargement in form and treatment, and, indeed,
with variation and shading in execution ; if several

of this kind is noticeable in The Priiice of Homburg,

of antiquity has essentially contributed to separate
our drama from the stage productions of the middle
ages, and give it a more artistic structure and more
profound meaning. Therefore, before an account is
given of the technical arrangement in the tragedies
of Sophocles, it will be necessary to recall those
peculiarities of the ancient stage, which, so far as
we can judge, with their demands and limitations,
controlled the Athenian poet. What is easily found
elsewhere will be but briefly mentioned here.
The tragedy of the old world grew out of the
dithyrambic solo songs with choruses, which were
used in the Dionysian spring-time festivals ; gradu
ally the speeches of individuals were introduced
between the dithyrambs and choruses, and were
enlarged to an action. The tragedy retained from
beginnings, the chorus, the song of single
leading roles in the moments of highest excitement,

these

the alternating songs of the actors and of the chorus.
It was a natural consequence that the part of the
tragedy won the mastery, and the chorus receded.

In the oldest plays of ^Eschylus,

wise the name of the piece was taken from the cos
tume and character of the chorus.
Next him stood
the second contestant, as his attendant and asso
ciate ; over against him stood the third, a less
esteemed actor, as character player, intriguer, repre
sentative of the counter-play.
This appointment was strictly adhered to by
Sophocles, in the preparation and distribution of
parts. There were in his plays, the chief hero, his
attendant, and his adversary.
But the subordinate
parts, also, which each of them must undertake, and
which corresponded to each of the chief roles, were,
so far as was at all possible, distributed according
to their relations to the chief roles.
The chief actor,
himself, took the part of his representative and com
panion in sentiment ; the parts of friends and
retainers, so far as possible, the second player took ;
the third, or adversary, took the parts of strangers,
enemies, opposing parties ; and in addition to these,
sometimes

accessory roles.
From all this there originated a peculiar kind of
stage effects, which we might call inartistic, but

which had for the Attic poet, and the Attic stage,
not a little significance. The next duty of the actor
was specially to indicate every one of the roles he
assumed in a piece, by a different mask, a different
tone of voice, a different carriage, and different ges
tures.

afford resistance.
Notice the malicious hardness of
Athene, in Ajax. It is called out by contrast with
the humanity of Odysseus, and shows the needed
contrast in color with an unscrupulous sharpness,
whereby naturally the goddess comes short of her
self, because she will sagaciously illuminate with
her divinity the shadowing of her nature, which is
like Menelaus's.
The same piece gives in every
scene a good insight into the manner of his crea
tion, which is so spontaneous, and withal so powerful
in effects, so carelessly sovereign, that we easily
understand how the Greeks found in it something di
vine. Everywhere here, one mood summons another,
one character another, exact, pure, certain ; each
color, each melody, forces forward another corre
sponding to it. The climax of the piece is the
frame of mind of Ajax after the awakening.
How
nobly and humanly the poet feels the nature of the
man under the adventurous presuppositions of the
piece ! The warm-hearted, honest, hot-headed hero,
the ennobled Berlichingen of the Greek army, had
been several times churlish toward the gods ; then
misfortune came upon him. The convulsing despair
of a magnificent nature, which is broken by disgrace
and shame, the touching concealment of his deter
mination to die, and the restrained pathos of a

have slain his foes in mad hatred, displays an
unusual strength of family affection, true-hearted,

the distant brother, toward the child, toward his wife;

Sophocles, a specially impressive introduction of the

The play of Antigone contains — besides prologue

Each of these parts, separated

from the others by a choral song, embraces a scene

tive, because in comparing it with the Libation Pourers

of .<Eschylus and the Electro, of Euripides, which treat
the same material, we recognize distinctly how the
poets prepared for themselves, one after another,
the celebrated legend.
In Sophocles, Orestes, the
central point of two pieces in yEschylus's trilogy,
is treated entirely as an accessory figure ; he per
forms the monstrous deed of vengeance by com

mand of and as the

tool of Apollo, deliberate,
with no trace of doubt or vacillation,

composed,
like a warrior who has set out upon a dangerous

undertaking ; and only the catastrophe represents
this chief part of the old subject dramatically.
What the piece presents is the mental perturbations
of an extremely energetic and magnificent female
character, but shaped for the requirements of the
stage in a most striking manner, by changes in feel
ing, through will and deed. In the prologue, Orestes
and his warden give the introduction and the expo

sition of the exciting force (arrival of the avengers),
which works at first in the action as a dream and
presentiment of Clytemnestra. The first stage of the
rising action follows this : Electra receives from

scene with Marinelli lies the exciting force, the
approaching marriage of Emilia. The first ascent
is in the following short scene, with the prince, in his
determination to meet Emilia at the Dominicans'. In
Tasso, the decking of the statues with garlands by
the two women indicates the prevailing mood of the
piece ; their succeeding conversation and the talk
with Alphonso is the exposition. Following this, the
decking of Tasso with wreaths by the princess is
the exciting force ; the entrance of Antonio and his
cool contempt for Tasso is the first stage of the
rising action. So in Mary Stuart, the forcing of the
cabinets, the confession to Kennedy, the entrance
of Mortimer, and the great scene between Mary and
the emissaries, follow after each other. In William
Tell, where the three actions are interwoven, there
stands after the situation near the beginning, which

the making of Melchthal's father blind ; and as

Therefore, it is the duty of the poet to gather up
these contrasts in a few utterances, and to express
their inner significance with continuous, progressive

force.

reasonings of one strike
like waves against the soul of the other, broken at
first by resistance, then rising higher, till, perhaps, at
the

last they rise above the resistance itself. It happens
according to an old law of composition, that fre
quently the third such wave-beat gives the decision ;
for if the proposition and counter-proposition have
each made two excursions, by these two stages the
hearer is sufficiently prepared for the decision ; he
has received a strong impulse, and has been ren
dered capable of conveniently comparing the weight

of the

reasons with the strength of the character on

which they are to work.

have been finely elaborated with great attractiveness
on our stage, since Lessing's time. They correspond

The utterance of lyric
emotions on the stage, if it is at all continued, will,
in spite of all poetic art, certainly weary the hearer

;

it becomes the dramatic poet's profitable task then,
to invent a little occurrence in which the ardent
feeling of the loving pair can express itself by mu
tual participation in a moment of the action ; in
this way he possesses the dramatic thread on which
to string his pearls.
The sweet love chatter which
has no purpose beyond itself, he will rightly avoid;

even to illusion,

The Brutus

of Shakespeare is a high-minded
gentleman, but he has been reared an aristocrat ; he
is accustomed to read and to think ; he has the
enthusiasm to venture great things, but not the
circumspection and prudence to put them through.
Csesar is a majestic hero who has passed a victor
ious, a great life, and who has proved his own
excellence in a time of selfishness and pretentious
weakness ; but with the lofty position, which he has
given himself above the heads of his contempo
raries, ambition has come upon him, simulation
and secret fear. The fearless man who has risked
his life a hundred times and feared nothing but the
appearance of being afraid, is secretly superstitious,
variable, exposed to the influence of weaker men.

should weave his destiny with that of Wallenstein.
Since there was needed in this gloomy material, a
warmer life, brighter colors, a succession of gentle
and touching feelings, the author created Max.
This poor, unsuspecting child of the camp, was at
once the opposite of his father and of his general.

The poet

cared too little, with respect to this figure,
that it stood a fresh, harmless, unspotted nature, in

contradiction to its own presupposed conditions, and
to the unbridled life of a soldier, in which it had
grown up ; for Schiller was not at all careful to give
motive to anything, if it only served his purpose.

It

satisfied him that this being, through character
and aptness, could come into a noble and sharplycut contrast with the hero and his opponent; and
so him, and the corresponding figure of his beloved,
the poet produced with a fondness which deter
mined even the form of the drama.

through reflection as the indwelling law of intellec

historical characters according to the demands of
the action, specially shown to be different in different
authors ; but the same poetic mind does not always
appear equally free and unembarrassed before all
its heroes. It is possible that a strong poetic power
may seek, for some purpose, to represent with special
care, single historical traits in the life of a hero.
In the completed work, then, this care is recognized
in a peculiar wealth of appropriate features, which

If upon our stage, Tristan had
married one woman to conceal his relations with
another woman, the actor of his part would incur
the danger of being pelted with apples from the

The poverty of dramatic life makes difficult to
the poet the understanding and the portrayal of

there was something very peculiar, something which
made their character at times quite mysterious.

did what was received mirror itself again in speech
and action ; they worked it over slowly and quietly ;
and what flowed from them had a strong subjective
coloring, and an addition from their own spirit,
which we might, in the earliest times, call lyric.
Therefore the oldest poetry of the Germans stands
in most striking contrast to the epic of the Greeks ;
its chief affair is not the rich, full narrative of the
action, but a sharp relief of single, brilliant traits,
the connecting of the force to an elaborate image,
a representation in short, abrupt waves, upon which

ornament of speech comes by natural necessity,
everywhere, into the discourse of men, where the
soul, in a lofty mood freely raises her wing.

To the

inspired orator, as to the poet, to every people, to
every civilization, comparison and imagery are the
immediate expressions of excited feeling, of power
ful, spirited creation.
But now it is the duty of the
poet to represent with the greatest freedom and
elevation the greatest embarrassment of his persons
in their passions.
It will also be inevitable that his
characters, even in the moments of highest passion,
evince far more of this inward creative power of
speech, of unrestrained power and mastery of lan

And yet here lies the great danger to the poet, that
his style may seem too artificial for the passion.
Our greatest poets have often used poetic means
and devices with such lavishness in moments of
intense passion, as to offend good taste.

known that Shakespeare yields too often to the

of this sweet passion which presses from one soul to
another, is so tender, is in so few words, is so
modest, that in art it brings one into despair. A
quick gleam from the eye, a soft tone of the voice,
may express more to the loved one than all speech.

the artistic.
In the face of these difficulties which the expres

the poet, the best advice would be, to remain as ex

The same laws which have been enumerated for
the action, apply also to the characters of the stage.
These, too, must possess dramatic unity, probability,
importance and magnitude, and be fitted for a strong
and progressive expression of dramatic life.

The persons of the drama must exhibit only that
side of human nature, by which the action is ad

in this place, briefly, once more.
Every single
person of the drama is to show the fundamental
traits of his character, as distinctly, as quickly, and
as attractively as possible ; and where an artistic
effect lies in a concealed play of single roles, the
audience must be, to a certain extent, the confidant
of the poet. The later a new characteristic trait
enters the action, the more carefully must the
motive for it be laid in the beginning, in order
that the spectator may enjoy to the full extent
the pleasure of the surprise, and perceive that it
corresponds
exactly to the constitution of the
character.
Brief touches are the rule, where the chief char
acters have to present themselves at the beginning
of the play. As a matter of course, the significant

piece, which prepare the moods, must also at the

actor has in his eye the effects of his role, and the
poet thinks of the aggregate effect, in many cases
there may be in the rehearsal of the piece, a divis

The poet will not always accord
to his associate the better right, — if it is necessary
to temper an effect, or to suppress a single char
acter in single moments of an action. Experience
teaches that the actor, in such a contradiction of

These requirements may be traced back to two

great principles, to the proposition which may be
stated: The stage effect must be clear to the poet
while he is composing; and to the short but very
imperative proposition : The poet must know how
to create great dramatic effects for his characters.
In every individual scene, specially in scenes where
groups appear, the poet must keep well in mind the

this is true of the characters and theiv move

For at every point in the
drama, in every sentiment, in every act, that which
in the material of the play struck us as characteristic,

It is seldom neces

with these colors toward scenic effects ; for his

highest task is, of course, to have his heroes speak

intelligible to every period, because, in every time
they are possible and conceivable.

he perceived to be attractive.

he will, however, now here, now there, during his

in this direction ; and it is pleasant to notice the

oscillations, in themselves. They may be perceived
in the works of even great poets. One scene is dis
tinguished by a vivid conception of the scenic
action,

the discourse is broken, the effects more
exactly harmonized by transitions ; at another time,
it flows more agreeably for the reader than for the
actor.
And however rightly the poet may have
perceived the sum of scenic effects, in detail, the
sense of the words and the effect which,

from the
writing-table, they produce on the receptive mind,
have had more of his attention than their sound,

Even

Aristotle comprehended

most

thoroughly this first part of the poet's work, the fashioning and
developing of the poetic idea. If, in comparison with history,
he makes poetry the more significant and philosophical, because
poetry represents what is common to all men, while history
gives an account of the incidental, or special detail ; and
because history presents what has happened, while poetry
shows how it could have happened, — yet we moderns,
impressed with the weight and grandeur of historical ideas,
must reject his comparative estimate of the two fundamentally
different kinds of composition ; we shall, however, concede
the fine distinction in his definition. He indicates, in a sen
tence immediately following this and often misunderstood,
the process of idealization. He says, IX., 4: "That which in
poetry is common to humanity, is produced in this way, — the
speeches and actions of the characters are made to appear
probable and necessary ; and that which is humanly universal
poetry works out from the raw material and then gives to the
characters appropriate, names," — whether using those already
at hand in the raw material or inventing new ones. (Buckley's
translation is as follows : But universal consists indeed in
relating or performing certain things which happen to a man
of a certain description, either probably or necessarily, to
which the aim of poetry is directed in giving names.) Aris
totle was of the opinion, too, that a poet would do well at the
beginning of his work to place before himself the material
which had attracted him, in a formula stripped of all inciden
tals, or non-essentials ; and he develops this idea more fully in
"

the drama are not at all the same as those in the material

it is almost an accident that they bear these names. Only when
the poet has raised his actions and his characters above the
incidental, the real, that which has actually happened, and in
place of this has put a meaning, a significance which will be
generally received, which appears to us probable and necessary.
— only then is he again to make use of color and tone, names
and circumstances,
from the raw material." Therefore it is
also possible that dramas which have been taken from very
different realms of material, express, fundamentally, the same
meaning, or, as we put
represent the same poetical idea.
This
the thought in the passages cited.

an immense outlay. A change of the entire background during
the representation was not allowable; and the mere transposi
tion of the periakte, if these had been introduced at all in the
time of Sophocles, would be to the taste of an ancient stage
director as imperfect an arrangement as the change of side cur
tains, without the change of background, would be to us. It
may not be so well known that Shakespeare, who treats time
and space with so much freedom, because the fixed architecture
of his stage spared him from indicating, or made it easy for
him to indicate the change of scenes, presented his pieces on a
stage which was the unornamented successor of the Attic pros
cenium. This proscenium had been gradually transformed by
slight changes into the Roman theater, the mystery-platform
of the middle ages, and the scaffold of Hans Sachs. On the ft
other hand, the same classical period of the French theater,
which so rigidly and anxiously sought to revive the Greek tra-.
ditions, has bequeathed us the deep, camera-like structure of
our stage, which had its origin in the needs of the ballet and
the opera.

for a more profound reason. The inner life of the debauched
Antony possessed no great wealth, and in its new infatuation
offered the poet little that was attractive. But his darling
dramatic figure, Cleopatra, in the development of which he had
evinced his consummate,
masterly art, was not a character
adapted to great dramatic emotion and excitement; the various
scenes in whieh she appears full of passionate demeanor with
out passion, resemble brilliant variations of the same theme.
In her relations with Antony she is portrayed just often
enough and from the most diverse points of view to present a
rich picture of the vixenish coquette.
The return of Antony
gave the poet no new task with respect to her. On the other
hand, the exaltation of this character in a desperate situation,
under the fear of death, was a fascinating subject for him, and
to a certain extent rightly so ; for herein was an opportunity
for a most peculiar, gradual intensification. Shakespeare, then,

Octavianus and his sister, just at the summit of the action,

insignificant, while the poet was contemplating, prophetically
and reverentially, the historical and established order of things.

behind the scenes to change his costume, or to pass from his
door to the side-entrance, through which he must enter in a
new role. Thirteen lines and two strophes of a little chorus
suffice for the deuteragonist whose exit, as Jocasta, has been
made through the back-door, to change costume and reappear
upon the stage as shepherd from the field side. Upon the stage
of the Acropolis this was no little distance.

songs of the chorus. Only CEdipus at Colonos is longer. If,
again, the number of verses of each of the three players is on
the average about equal, the tragedies of a day, together with
a burlesque of the length of The Cyclops (about 500 verses for
three players) would give to each player a total of about 1,300
verses. But the task of the first player was already, on account
of the affecting pathos scenes and on account of the songs, dis
proportionately greater. Besides, much more must be expected
from him. If in the three pieces of Sophocles in which the
hero suffers from a disease inflicted by the gods (Ajax, The
Trachinian Women, Philoctetes) the parts of the first player
are summed up, (Ajax, Teucros, Heracles, Lichas, Philoc
tetes) there will be about 1,440 verses; and with the burlesque,
there will be about 1,600 verses : and there is the effort
required to carry through six roles and sing about six songs.

The roles marked * are uncertain. Besides the three act
ors, the Attic stage always had several accessory players for
dumb-show roles : thus in Electra, Pylades ; in The Trachin
ian Women, the especially distinguished role of Iole in which
perhaps Sophocles would present to the public a young actor
whom he esteemed. It is probable that these accessory players
sometimes relieved the actors of less important subordinate
roles, — for example, in Antigone, Eurydice, which is treated
very briefly ; and in The Trachinian Women, the maid-servant
of the prologue. How else could they test their voices and
their powers?
Such aid as was rendered by characters dis
guised from the audience by masks, was not reckoned playing.
The accessory actors were also needed as representatives of the
three players upon the stage, if the presence of a mask was
desirable in a scene, and the player of this scene must at the
same time assume another role ; then the accessory player fig
ured in like costume and the required mask, as a rule without
saying any lines ; but sometimes single lines must be given
him. Thus Ismene, in the second half of CEdipus at Colonos,
is represented by an accessory player, while the player himself

the player had practiced the voice, and so forth, this substi
tution for a single scene did not offer special difficulty. It is
possible, however, that the player of the role of Antigone, also
gave the first Theseus scene. Antigone has gone into the grove
in the'background, in order to watch her father ; she may very
conveniently appear again as Theseus, while a stage-walker
goes up and down in her mask. If even in this play, a fourth
actor had taken part, in any role of importance, some account
would have come to us of what even at that time would have
been a striking innovation.
