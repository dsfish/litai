Love-Kiss xli
The Mutability of Human Affairs

Gregor. Nazianzenus in Oration, de Pauperibus amandis.
Nihil est in rebus humanis Natura stabile, nihil aequabile, nihil sufficiens,
nihil in eodem statu permanens: sed omnia quadam veluti rota circumvolvuntur,
diversas saepe diebus singulis, atque etiam horis vicissitudines afferente.

all things do change; all things do love; all things are locked in hate:

whoever fully thinks this through / holds the key to man's estate.

Lover of Heaven! this Love-Kiss constitutes a complete permutation phrase [Wechselsatz] in its first twelve lines; each of which/if you leave only the first word and the last

two words intact / may be permutated using the thirteen other words to achieve 622720800 or six-hundred-twenty-two-million-seven-hundred-twenty-thousand-and-eight
hundred variations. To match this permutation, incomprehensible as it may be for ordinary folk, the most skilled writer / coming up with more than a thousand permutation lines
a day/ would nevertheless have his plate full for an entire century. Should it behoove someone / to generate a permutation phrase from the fifty words of the first four lines / then

all the people world over/should they attempt to carry this out simultaneously/could not accomplish it /because it could be permutated so many million times/ that our four
quartered globe could not contain the number of grains of sea sand that this number would amount to. For fifty words / according to the calculation of Kircher can be permutated into:

At first glance, what is printed here above/seems impossible; yet just as certainly as two times two makes six/so this too is the case. It might seem even more implausible/and
here I have the greatest authorities to back me up / and can only argue this briefly here/though at greater length elsewhere/ that the major portion of Human Knowledge in fact

lies hidden in permutation. Oh come join up with me, all you practitioners of Wisdom! Why would all of you dimwits want to peer into mere hollowness of appearance? Sharpen
your perceptions! Consider the inner essence of such miraculous transmutations! Have faith/that you will discover the core of all languages/and playfully instruct the world as to

what it so laboriously seeks and so pathetically lacks. You toss aside all the precious pearls of wisdom/and quarrel about mere baubles of glass/that glint with a tawdry sheen; but
just as these are blown into existence/so they collapse. O you who are wise to the world/take heed/of Plato's words/when he exclaims in the Timaeus:
If you understand numbers (i.e. their innermost being), you shall understand everything.

Besides, as harsh as the above Love-Kiss might sound to your ears, it will resonate all the more sweetly to your hearts. Like a nugget of gold or clump of earth, it contains within itself

the seeds of rhetoric, ethics, philosophy, mathematics, geography, music, astronomy, medicine, nature, law, writing,/and the more you seek within it/the more you will discover.
Present circumstances prevent me from expatiating / because space does not permit /but should I be so bold to indicate/this contested truth/an enormous volume would not suffice
to contain the essence of our Love-Kiss/ even if you tore back its curtain / revealed its treasures and split it limb to limb. On such a fundament rests the whole Art of Comparison / and

ever so savvy, called to his art by the four-parted globe, the man in charge of constructing these splendid buildings of meaning is none other than the German athanasius kircher,
as every careful reader will learn as he proceeds, and will especially come to recognize in the Art of Wisdom of Lullus.
If you, Lover of Heaven, take all this in with sympathetic eyes / and accept my zealous suggestions / we shall not hesitate to inform others of this matter / with mature judgment

and ripeness of experience/ wheresoever divine grace might give us the life and opportunity to do so. ? qk
